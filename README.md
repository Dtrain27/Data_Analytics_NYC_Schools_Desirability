# Data_Analytics_NYC_Schools_Desirability
Data Analytics Spring 2021 Final Project

## Abstract and Project:
For many parents, sending their children to “good” schools is their number one priority. However, what makes a school so desirable it is labeled by many as a “good” school? Is it their SAT scores or graduation and drop out rates or is it something more subtle like their location and distance from various healthy food vendors. As a result, the goal of this project was to analyze the data collected from New York City’s schools and determine what schools are desirable based on a variety of data features. These features include: graduation percentage, the number of graduates, the dropout percentage, the number of dropouts, average SAT scores, the borough the schools is located in, the distance from Low Income Housing and the distance from Healthy Food Vendors. Now, one might be asking why investigate New York City’s schools? There are three primary reasons for selecting New York City’s schools. The first being New York City makes its data publicly available which makes it easy to access and utilize for this project. The second is of a personal investment as many friends and co-workers grew up in or near the city and consistently discuss New York City’s schools. The final reason is because of the unique situation involving New York City’s schools and those that enroll in them. Since the city possesses such an expansive network of subways, it creates an interesting environment to investigate this problem and determine if the location of the school plays as much of a role in it’s desirability as the other various factors.

## Running The Project:
1. Run the GenData.py script to generate the combined data csv (Note: will take some time to generate)
2. Run the GenerateAndTestModels.py script to generate and test the following models:
      1. Logistic Regression
      2. Random Forest
      3. KNN
      4. KMeans

Note: This project contains several additional scripts used for reporting and exploring the data
